        "LongDescription": "A little while ago I discovered that by adding someone as a friend in the game Mario Kart Tour, more data was sent to my game than was revealed in the menus. I wanted to find a way to use this to present and preserve the data, thus, the Account Snapshot project was created! Sadly, it seemed to be too difficult for people to be able to use the script to dump their data themselves, so I ended up making a system where others could join my Discord server and then request for one. I would give them a JSON file, which has all of the data of their profile I could access, and then have them upload that file to this project website hosted on my GitHub site, giving a visual and much prettier version of their profile. It also included various calculations made on the data as well. Over 425 people were given a snapshot at one time, and I'm proud of that number considering the manual system that had to be used.",

I wanted something more visual, it was a little difficult for me to visualize a bunch of numbers and rows. Thus, this project came to me. It allowed me to experiement with localStorage, saving your save data to a browser. No longer did I ever have to re-enter it like you would on spreadsheets. Needless to say, getting to see all of the courses on the game in a form that the game didn't allow you to visually was certainly helpful in choosing what to level up!",
